Erins bullshit - the secret sauce to this project
# Why this is open sourced <br>
- Basically, the reason i open sourced this was because if erin is going to share the source code to other users i might aswell let everyone else see it. This is now a worthless project to her, so i don't see why she would care. <br>

*Take care my lovelies* :)
